## Project 4: Full Stack project
- This will be a simple inventory management application.
- You should be able to add, view,  edit, and delete products.
- A product should contain the product name, description, price, and available stock.
- Your application should contain a front-end along with a working REST API.
- Throughout the project, proper validation should be used in both the front-end and back-end.
- You should be able to display the available products within a specific price range using server-side filtering. (You can use any suitable range for instance 500-1000, 1000-10000, etc)
- Write unit tests for both front-end and back-end.
- Create a branch from main branch and name it as 'YOUR_NAME-dev'. (e.g.: pabashani-dev)
- For this project create a branch from your dev branch (e.g.: pabashani-dev) and name it as 'YOUR_NAME-project-4'. (e.g.: pabashani-project-4)
- When you have done your changes create a Pull Request from your branch into your dev branch.

  #### Front-End
  - Use ESLint and prettier for your front-end.
  - Use a CSS framework. (ex: Bootstrap, Tailwind)
  - Use a global state management tool. (ex: Redux, Zustand)
 
  #### Back-End
  - Draw an ER diagram.
  - Use an Object Relational Mapping tool like Hibernate.
  - Use MySQL as the database technology.
